## Introduction to rebase

There is another way of merging branches: *rebase*. This is how conceptually works. Green branch is the HEAD:

Git looks for the first commit in spaghetti that is also a commit in master. It's this commit here.

This is the base of this spaghetti branch. All the history before this commit is already shared between the two branches,
so it's not relevant here. Now Git detaches the entire spaghetti branch from this commit and moves it on top of master,
so it changes the base of this branch. That's why it's called a rebase.

Suppose to switch to master branch e rebase spaghetti, as in the merge we will have:

Just like in a merge, we have all the commits that deal with the spaghetti and all the commits that deal with the pie in the same 
history. However, different than a merge, we got that result not by letting multiple branches flow together, but by rearranging the
branches so that they look like one single branch.

## Rebase under the hood

We explained a simplified version of rebase. 
What happens if you change the parent of this commit?

The parents SHA1 is stored inside the commit, so the commit data must change, and the commit must get a new SHA1. 
Now that this commit has a new SHA1, this other commit

 also has to change because its own parent has changed, so it gets a new SHA1 as shown for all the commits in the branch. 
 So Git cannot just move the commits. The commits in the rebase branch must have different SHA1s, so there must be different objects in the database. In other words, new commits, and indeed that's what they are. Here is how rebasing really works. When you rebase, Git makes copies of the commits. It creates new commits with mostly the same data, actually exactly the same data except for their parents.

 So these new commits look almost exactly like the original commits, but they are new objects with new SHA1s, so they are new files with new file names in the database directory. And finally, Git moves the rebase branch to the new commits leaving the old commits behind.

 Git garbage-collects unreachable objects
